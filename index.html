<b>Abstract</b> This report has been compiled in order to give a brief and general overview of the Na'vi species present on the Pandora moon. While by no means exhaustive, it compiles results of years long scientific research about this species, their behaviour, society and environment.

<h3>Anatomy and behaviour of a Na'vi</h3>

<p>The Na'vi are quite disctinct from other species observed on pandora. They are bipedal, with feet similar to the earthen hominidae family in shape, with four toes on each feet. They feature two arms attached on each side of the upper part of the torso, each having forearms and four fingered hands. A tail is also attached to their back. Their head is round, and feature two eyes, a nose, a mouth and ears. Their face is also used in a social setting to perform complex communication with their peers, or threaten other species with growls. The specimens we observed range from 2.7m up to 3m in height. Their skin is blue and striped, as to camouflage efficiently in the colorful nature of Pandora. They are omnivores eating meat from hunting and roots or berries collected in the jungle. Their intellectual capabilities are similar to humans, as they are able to learn a language, elaborate long term plans, and understand complex mechanism in a similar fashion to humans. </p>

<p>The Na'vi, like the majority of pandora's fauna, have a tendril feature protruding from the back of their heads, surrounded by hair (resembling a long plait or queue), with a high number of connections to their brain. This organ allows them to connect with other organisms around them, by transferring electrochemical signals. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the only species that uses it in a parasitic fashion to control other animals. The underlying mecanisms are not completely understood yet, but it is known that a Na'vi can take complete control of a few other species to help them in their hunt, or as a social status symbol. This parasitism can happen in multiple ways, often through violence or surprise, and are always initiated by the Na'vi. It is suggested that, for the control to work on so many different species without any evolutive mutation stopping it, the Na'vi performed a domestication of those species by caring for the individuals that were the most vulnerable to their control, and killing the ones that were the most resistant to it. It is to be noted that in their mythology, it is called "symbiosis". However, the previous points show that animal control through the tendril is a one sided experience.</p>

<h3>Social structure of a group of Na'vi</h3>

<p>The Na'vi have a typical Hunter-Gatherer social structure. The implications of this observation is beyond the scope of this report. Nevertheless, knowing this enables us to understand with much more certainty their societal values, as we can use our knowledge of human Hunter-Gatherer societies to complete black spots in our observation of this species.</p> 

<p>The Na'vi society value strength and hunting prowess above all else. Their leaders are selected through this criteria alone, and their rite of passage to adulthood consists of executing various combat related prowesses (parasiting a Mountain Banshee through violence being one of them). Such tasks are quite dangerous, and not all Na'vi youngs make it safely to adulthood.</p> 
    
<p>Once in adulthood, a typical Na'vi will start to look for a mate to reproduce with. Strong competition occurs again, with individuals taking more high risk behaviours in order to impress their opposed sex counterpart. Once they have found a mate, the Na'vi stay together for life. This can lead to problems later in their life. If one individual from the couple dies prematurely, the other one is now unable to mate again, and are destined to a life of solitude without offspring. It is also at this age that the Na'vi partake in tribal wars, fighting other Na'vi groups for the control of territory and resources.</p>
    
<p>At this stage, most of the Na'vi will die due to the multitude of risks a Na'vi is exposed to in their life. However a few make it past their active years into old age. As the sight of an old Na'vi is rare, it is hypothised that like human Hunter-Gatherer societies, the Na'vi perform economical killing of their older population. Old Na'vi not being able to feed themselves from the hunt are a burden to the hyper-competitive, hyper-violent tribe, and therefore the tribe gets rid of them to reduce the number of useless mouths to feed. This seem not to apply to the higher classes of Na'vi society like the shamans, or the tribe leader's mate for instance. The homicide rate in human Hunter-Gatherer societies is estimated at around 25%, it is expected that the equivalent number in Na'vi society to be much higher in consideration of the different points presented previously.</p>

<h3>Relationship with humans</h3>

<p>Since their arrival to Pandora, Humans-Na'vi relations are an important factor for both species future. Humanity's first approach was a scientific pursuit of knowledge, and, as the Na'Vi are a sentient species, an educational effort aimed at teaching them about the world surrounding them. This second effort failed, as religious entities within the Na'vi tribe forbade any scientific teaching and only the language education remains active today.</p>

<p>Perspectives for further cooperation between those two species are however bleak. The human expedition being spearheaded by the need for unobtainium minerals, will fataly enter in conflit with some Na'vi tribes for the control of territories where large amount of this resource is available. With the current price of this resource, and the valuation of human life at approximately 10 million dollars, some deposits are financially worth more than a few million human lives. Considering this and current standards of human ethics, it can be speculated that directing bodies of the human expedition may consider the forceful relocation of Na'vi tribes as the morally superior choice.</p>
